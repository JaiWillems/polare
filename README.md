# Stroke

The Stroke project focus is making a kernel for continuous data operations that
stores a continuous representation of input data. A Stroke enables data
operations previously performed on discrete data to be performed on a
continuous representation. This nature allows for the evaluation at any point
in the domain of the original data.

The program currently supports the following scalar-stroke and stroke to stroke
operations:

- Unary positive,
- Unary negative,
- Addition,
- Subtraction,
- Multiplication,
- True division,
- Power, and
- Absolute value.

Compatibility with NumPy ufunc operations is under development, along with
additional interpolation flavours.
